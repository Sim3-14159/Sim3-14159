# Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I am Simyon.

I have (and still am) creating new projects â€” most of them in **Python**.  
Some other languages I program in are **C++** (specifically **Arduino**), **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and a little bit of **Java**.

## ðŸ”§ Some of my latest & best projects:

- [**Arduino-compatible Snake clone**](https://github.com/Sim3-14159/Snake_Game)  
  A classic Snake game recreated for Arduino boards.

- [**make-executable**](https://github.com/Sim3-14159/Python_Modules/make-executable)  
  A simple Linux tool that allows you to make a command-line game or script executable.

## ðŸŽ® My **coolest** project:

- [**orpheus-example**](https://github.com/Sim3-14159/orpheus-example)  
  An **AI-powered game** demonstrating interactive storytelling and decision-making.

Thanks for checking out my projects!
