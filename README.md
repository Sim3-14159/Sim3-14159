# Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I am Simyon.

I have (and still am) creating new projects â€” most of them in **Python**.  
Some other languages I program in are **C++** (specifically **Arduino**), **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and a little bit of **Java**.

## ðŸ”§ Some of my best & latest projects:


1. [**orpheus-example**](https://github.com/Sim3-14159/orpheus-example)  
  An **AI-powered game** demonstrating interactive storytelling and decision-making.

1. [**cube-solving-app**](https://github.com/Sim3-14159/cube-solving-app)
   The code for an app that can solve 3x3 *Rubik's Cubes*. It has a nice GUI and demonstrates many ways to make a practical app with *tk* and `Tkinter`. It is also a great template for other apps.

1. [**Arduino-compatible Snake clone**](https://github.com/Sim3-14159/Snake_Game)  
  A classic Snake game recreated for Arduino boards.

1. [**make-executable**](https://github.com/Sim3-14159/Python_Modules/make-executable)  
   A simple Linux command-line tool that allows you to make a game or script executable.

1. [**Python_Modules**](https://github.com/Sim3-14159/Python_Modules)
  A bunch of useful modules for coding in Python.

    1. [**ansi_colors**](https://github.com/Sim3-14159/Python_Modules/ansi_colors)
       A simple module that uses ANSI-standard escape sequences to color statements to the standard output.

    1. [**MutableTypes**](https://github.com/Sim3-14159/Python_Modules/MutableTypes)
       A module containing classes for `MutableInt`, `MutableFloat`, `MutableBool`, `MutableStr`, etc. It is exactly what it sounds like: mutable versions of the primitive types.
